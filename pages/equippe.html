        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>I started this project in May, 2020 when the world was grappling with the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. During
            this time, severe personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages impacted essential organizations (EOs
            from here on) across North America. To help alleviate this burden, individuals and companies generously donated PPE
            to local EOs in need.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>But...</h4>
        <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/04/02/shelter-providers-say-lack-of-protective-gear-puts-workers-and-homeless-in-danger-1270315" target="_blank"><img class="news-clippings" src="../images/Politico-New-York.JPG" alt="Shelter providers say lack of protective gear puts workers and homeless in danger."></a>

        <br>

        <h4>The problem</h4>
        <p>Despite the outpour of support, there were instances of EOs such as homeless shelters, municipal sanitation, food
            processing plants, pharmacies, and emergency services, among others that struggled to secure the bare minimum to
            ensure a relatively safe work environment. Considering quantities are finite, I wondered if a more equitable
            distribution of PPE donations would be possible to help prevent such instances.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Why could this be happening?</h4>
        <p>I hypothesized and shortlisted four factors potentially contributing to the issue.</p>    
        <ul>
            <li>Limited mainstream media coverage of PPE needs of non-healthcare EOs</li>
            <li>EOs do not have a go-to platform to voice their needs to PPE donors</li>
            <li>Donors are unsure or unaware of local EOs in need of PPE</li>
            <li>Donors are only donating to EOs they are familiar with or have heard of</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To get a better understanding of the last two points, I surveyed 12 PPE donors (aged 22 to 54). Although a smaller sample size, my findings
            suggested that donors are willing to donate PPE to EOs other than the ones they donated to, had they known.
            Proximity and line of work carried the greatest importance when it comes to deciding where to donate.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h1 id="personas">User personas</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I used news articles of people interviewed on behalf of EOs experiencing PPE shortages, as well as sentiments shared
            by PPE donors I surveyed, to generate two user personas – Lori and Nathan.
        </p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/Lori-card.png" alt="User persona">

        <hr class="divider">
    
        <h1 id="solution">Proposed solution</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Design an app that would help direct PPE donations to EOs in need by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Allowing EOs (including healthcare) like Second Home, to submit requests for PPE they desperately need</li>
            <li>Displaying requests to local PPE donors like Nathan, so they are aware and may consider donating</li>
            <li>Ensuring a donation process that is direct and convenient</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Comparable services</h4>
        <p>Here are two (of many) existing services that share similar goals.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Get Us PPE</em><br>
            During the planning stages back in May, I came across <a class="in-text-link" href="https://getusppe.org/" target="_blank">getusppe.org</a>, a website founded by medical professionals in
            the US whose aim was to facilitate PPE donations to hospitals that need it most. Get Us PPE helped me understand the
            details required to ensure a successful donation process, which I adapted to suit my app’s framework. They have
            since expanded to allow PPE requests from select EOs like homeless shelters and social service organizations.
            Although I found this chart long after I began this project, it illustrates the lopsided nature of PPE shortages.
        </p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/Shortage-chart.jpg" alt="PPE shortage chart">

        <p><em>DonateTO</em><br>
            An initiative set up by the <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-how-you-can-help/covid-19-donateto/covid-19-donation-of-goods-and-services/" target="_blank">City of Toronto</a> in April, where PPE donors may fill out an online form to submit their
            donation offer. Once an offer is approved, the City directs donors to appropriate EOs in need.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        <br>
        <p><em>Misuse of PPE donations</em><br>
            With reports of unethical stockpiling of PPE, I anticipated that a portion of app users may misuse it to their
            advantage. To this end, EOs will be asked to identify when signing up, using Google Places API. Further verification
            may be required if there is a discrepancy between an EO’s official address and the PPE drop-off address specified
            during onboarding. An EO can only sign up once, and those suspecting an error or fraudulent activity being committed
            in their name will be able to report the problem.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Standards and efficacy of donated PPE</em><br>
            To minimize risk of receiving PPE that do not meet standards or are unsafe for use, EOs can checkoff specification
            options unique to the PPE they are requesting, as well as specifying whether they accept open boxes. Additionally,
            donors are asked to correctly identify their PPE, make sure it is unused, and if applicable, are certified, before
            donating. It ultimately would be an EO’s discretion to use donated PPE.
        </p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h1 id="goal1">Goal #1: Requesting PPE</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I started by understanding the relevant info that would be needed from EOs, like Second Home, requesting for PPE.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Number of members</em><br>
            I was in touch with Seamus O’Hara, the project coordinator of Ontario PPE Collective, which is a network of
            volunteers who 3D print and distribute face shields to those requesting it. He mentioned he received requests for
            quantities that were up to 12 times more than what was needed for an EO, as some were unaware that face shields are
            reusable. To decide on a reasonable quantity, the collective asked to input the organization size when submitting a
            request.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Line of work</em><br>
            Lori can help donors understand how Second Home serves the community (in this case, nonprofit) by selecting from an
            adapted list of eight categories deemed as essential by the governments of US and Canada.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>PPE ratings and specifications</em><br>
            Ratings and specifications vary between PPE. In Lori’s case, she prefers hand sanitizers contain minimum 70%
            alcohol. Certain EOs, like those in healthcare, have stringent guidelines for PPE standards. To this end, having the
            option to specify these details is critical.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Request quantities - to specify, or not to specify? That is the question.</em><br>
            It may seem like a no-brainer to allow EOs to specify the quantities of a PPE they are requesting for. With better
            understanding and thinking it through, I decided to exclude it for the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>EOs accept frequently used/disposable PPE on a rolling basis</li>
                <li>Donors, especially those intending to donate larger quantities, may be misguided if an EO does not proactively
                    update their requested quantities as they receive donations</li>
                <li>Proactively updating quantities can be a burden</li>
                <li>The number of members in an EO is provided to help donors decide their donation quantity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Donation drop-off address</em><br>
            By default, this could be set to Second Home’s address, retrieved from Google Places. It can be changed if an EO prefers to receive donations at an alternate address, although a verification process could be prompted based on:
            <ul>
                <li>Proximity between official address and alternate drop-off address</li>
                <li>Number of requests submitted</li>
                <li>If the user frequently changes the drop-off address after signing up</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Donation pick-up</em><br>
            Second Home, like many EOs, is offering to pick up from donors who may be unable to drop off their donation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Request view count</em><br>
            Once Lori submits a request, having a view count would help her track how many PPE donors have seen it, and may consider donating.

        <h1 id="goal2">Goal #2: Find EOs in need</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            What could be an optimal format to display PPE requests to donors like Nathan? I had the idea of a real-time request
            feed. During onboarding, donors would enable their location (or input ZIP/postal code) and select PPE they wish to
            donate, which tailors their feed to show requests from nearby EOs. The feed can also be filtered by distance, line
            of work, and EOs offering donation pick-up. Through the request feed, donors become aware of local EOs they may not
            have considered donating to previously.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Request cards</em><br>
            Request cards highlight EO details and PPE they are requesting. They would sit slightly elevated over the request
            feed, cueing donors to tap for further details. Request cards can be saved by donors for later reference.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>EO page</em><br>
            When tapped, a request card pulls up the respective EO’s page where their PPE requests and donation instructions are available.

        <h1 id="goal3">Goal #3: Ensuring a convenient donation process</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the initial design and even leading up to the final prototype, donors requesting pick-up would have to arrange by
            calling or emailing EOs. Although this aspect of the donation experience went unremarked during usability tests, I
            felt the urge to streamline it further. I went ahead and integrated a ‘Request pick-up’ feature, which allows donors
            and EOs to arrange pick-ups through just a few screen taps. This proved beneficial as:
        <ul>
            <li>Donors can now submit a pick-up request in under 1.5 minutes on average, which would have otherwise taken longer had they called or emailed</li>
            <li>EOs can confirm pick-up requests at their convenience, import scheduled pick-ups to their phone calendars, and share pick-up details with their drivers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1 id="visual-design">Visual design</h1>
        <br>
        <p><em>Material Design</em><br>
            Google’s Material Design documentation provided guidance on GUI layout standards and component behaviours, while
            highlighting their similarities and differences between Android and iOS, which I highly appreciated. I also used its
            free icon library.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Logo</em><br>
            I wanted the logo to represent kindness and protection. I chose to incorporate a face mask, as it became symbolic
            during this pandemic. To generate ideas, I folded a face mask into different configurations, with most resembling
            either a paraglider or a bag that drops off PPE. I liked a variation that resembled a heart, which I refined into
            the minimalistic graphic seen now.
        </p>

        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/mask-config.jpg" alt="Mask configurations for logo design">

        <br>
        <p><em>Colours</em><br>
            PPE typically come in colours associated with the medical field, such as teal and pastel blue. Using them as base
            colours, I played around on coolors.co to generate the palette. I contrast checked using WebAIM to ensure important text elements met WCAG standards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Typeface</em><br>
            My typeface choice for this project is Sans Source Pro, obtained through Google Fonts. The relatively taller
            x-height across its fonts affords more screen real estate and maintains a minimalistic feel, which I was keen on.
            Other typefaces I considered were Lato, Open Sans, Proxima Nova, and Roboto.

        <h1 id="ideas-left-out">Ideas left out/for future consideration</h1>
        <br>
        <p><em>Instructions to make PPE</em><br>
            I floated the idea to include instructions on how to DIY certain PPE items. While this feature may be useful, user
            feedback suggested otherwise, nor does it align with the main goals of this project.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Mark requests as fulfilled</em><br>
            After a usability test, a user suggested that EOs should be able to mark their requests as fulfilled once they no
            longer wish to receive donations of a PPE item, and I thought this might be a better option over deleting. However,
            deleting a request should still be an option even if their request was not fulfilled. So then what does it mean to
            mark a request as fulfilled? Would it be the equivalent of archiving an email? For now, when deleting a request, the
            app could perhaps prompt a dialogue box asking whether a request was fulfilled.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Allow essential workers to place requests for themselves</em><br>
            Currently, only EOs can request for PPE. This was a deliberate decision, as allowing individual essential workers to
            do the same would require addressing concerns such as identity and occupation verifications, in addition to personal
            security in the context of donation drop-offs and pick-ups.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Donation to donor tracing</em><br>
            Donors would attach a confirmation issued by the app that outlines their contact and donation details. This would
            allow EOs to inform donors in case their PPE is damaged or unusable.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Metric for drop-off donations</em><br>
            The current iteration directs donors to local EOs in need, but cannot confirm whether drop-offs are actually made.
            The donation to donor tracing system discussed above, if implemented, could address this. Another idea is to use a
            donor’s saved requests to send push notifications asking if they ended up donating to those requests.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>EO verification</em><br>
            Allows EOs to apply for verification, which would establish their credibility on the app and assure donors their
            donations will not be misused.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Optimizing pick-up scheduling and routing</em><br>
            It would be convenient for EOs to have the app automatically schedule and route pick-ups based on the dates and
            addresses provided by donors. This would be useful if EOs receive large volumes of pick-up requests.
        </p>

        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I’m proud to have completed my first UX project. In the process, I conducted surveys, reached out to those working on
            the frontlines, navigated through good and not-so-good ideas, and brought my messy wireframe sketches to life
            through Figma. I got to explore each step of the UCD process in detail, which I will carry forward and build upon in
            future projects. This project was possible thanks to the constant feedback I received from those in the field,
            friends, and family – their names can be found throughout the app prototype.</p>
