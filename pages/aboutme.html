                    <h1>About Thanvin</h1>
                    <p>Thanks for dropping by! I recently led the end-to-end UX development of a web service at <a class="in-text-link"
                        href="https://www.abodeatlas.com/" target="_blank">Abode Atlas</a>, a B2M data-tech startup and second-round funding recipient
                        of CMHC's Housing Supply Challenge. Prior to this project, I freelanced for three years 
                        as a Medical Media Designer for med-tech companies like Perimeter Medical Imaging and Hologic, where my
                        visuals were key in advancing their surgical suite products to market.<br>
                        <br>
                        Through UX, I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with seeing the lasting impact of a positive user experience. 
                        I also value working in an interdisciplinary environment, where I'm continuously learning from the expertise
                        and skills of fellow team members.<br>
                        <br>
                        For more on my UX journey and past experience, continue on. Aside from work, I love:<br>

                        With much of my work sharing parallels with UX design, I leveraged my experience to branch out in 2020.
                        I joined Abode Atlas on a six-month contract to lead the UX development of their web service from the ground up.<br>

                            "Having worked with Thanvin before, I was confident in his ability to lead the UX for our project. He quickly grasped
                            housing sector concepts, mapped out next steps, and carried out project milestones with ease. Aside from his excellence
                            as a UX designer, I valued his empathetic nature during engagement sessions, and in lending a hand to any teammate who
                            needed it. Thanvin will continue to truly be an asset to any team he joins."
