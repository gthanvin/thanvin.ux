                <p>I’m a science graduate from the University of Toronto with a strong design background stemming from CyberARTS, a
                four-year secondary school program dedicated for budding creatives. By integrating my passion for science and
                design, I freelanced as an animator for two innovative med-tech companies, Hologic and Perimeter Medical Imaging AI.
                My work was integral in FDA clearance submissions, clinician training, user guides, and marketing. I established an
                excellent rapport with directors, and collaborated with clinical and engineering teams to ensure my work aligned with their vision.
                <br>
                <br>
                Leveraging my professional experience and multidisciplinary approach, I branched into UX design. I’m confident in
                working alongside and learning from the brightest minds to cultivate digital solutions that bridge unmet needs. Most
                importantly, I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with seeing the lasting impact of a positive user experience. I
                look forward to working with you!</p>

                    requirements and deliver a quality result."

                    ability to get it right the first time has great impact on project time lines and demonstrates that he pays close
