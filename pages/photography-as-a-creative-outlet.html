        <h1>Photography as a creative outlet and means to explore</h1>
        <p class="light-grey">July 2021</p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/planespotting-cover.jpg" alt="Air Canada airplane passing over road traffic">
        <p class="light-grey">I photograph just about anything, including airplanes as I'm also a bit of an aviation geek. This was taken near Toronto's Pearson International Airport.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since 2015, <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/tgexplores/" target="_blank">photography</a> has been a constant passion of mine. When I initially bought the camera, I intended to use it
            mostly during trips and occasions to capture memories. This changed however, as I soon began to realize the creative
            potential that could be achieved through the medium.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started off taking photos on my walks around the neighbourhood, then worked through various locations in Toronto.
            My ability to choose and compose shots evolved with time, as I used to gravitate towards scenes that were readily
            laid out or were popular on social media, whereas now I’m more selective and look for unique angles, subframes,
            juxtapositions, lighting, and more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Within Toronto, I’ve done photowalks at least 30 locations and their vicinities. The saying, it’s about the journey,
            holds true as some of the more interesting captures are of hidden gems along the way. My knowledge of the city’s ins
            and outs continues to grow thanks to photography because it gives purpose and motivation for the trips I may not
            have made otherwise.</p>

        <p>I also bring my camera along on hikes and other scenic spots outside the city. I enjoy planning road trips with
            friends and seeking out prime locations (<a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.alltrails.com/" target="_blank">AllTrails</a> 
            is great) depending on what we’re hoping to see - fall colours, lakes, viewpoints, waterfalls, to name a few. 
            I love nature photography as leading lines and depth aren’t so defined compared to cityscapes, which makes composing 
            shots more challenging - and it’s just nice to get away from the concrete jungle once in a while.</p>

        <p>Photography’s been great in facilitating social aspects as well. Going on photowalks with friends and occasionally
            with interest groups offers chances to converse and share stories relating to things we spot along the way - so if
            you’re looking to get to know someone better or impress them with your photography skills, take them on a photowalk!

        <p>Writing this piece gave me the opportunity to reflect on the positive impact photography has had across various
            aspects of my life. Apart from being an alternative means through which I could explore my creativity and de-stress,
            it’s more importantly a gateway to new places, people, knowledge, and perspectives.</p>
