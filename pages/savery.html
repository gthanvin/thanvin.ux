        <h4>Project goals &#127919</h4>
        <p>Having worked on my first project independently, I wished to collaborate with a fellow UX designer this time. I had
            the pleasure to work with <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.lillian-lin.com/" target="_blank">Lillian</a>, whom I connected with through the Brooklyn Product Design
            Meetup Slack group. She was especially helpful early in the project as we actively evaluated our
            ideas and being accountable for oversights or biases. We made a point to generate ideas independently first before
            sharing them to minimize influencing each others' thoughts. I personally wanted to improve my research
            analysis (to create more representative user personas) and conducting usability tests.</p>

        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>Grocery cost is an expense people can control but isn’t necessarily easy. Deciding what to cook, buying the right
            ingredients on the next grocery trip while being conscious of cost are often times a hassle. This becomes a routine,
            with feelings of not having enough time to plan or try new recipes, cooking a limited variety of dishes every week,
            tediously sorting through flyers, and opting to eat out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Thankfully, there are apps freely available to those looking to make their lives easier. Yummly, Epicurious, NYT
            Cooking, Sidechef, Whisk, and Mealime allow users to browse recipes and populate a grocery list based on recipe
            ingredients. Some give users the liberty to store their own recipes for future reference. When it comes to
            saving cost, Flipp is a popular platform to compare prices across many local grocery stores and browse weekly offers.
        </p>

        <h4>What's the problem?</h4>
        <p>There isn’t a problem per se, as much as an inconvenience. Ideally, people using an app to sort out their meals and
            groceries would have a go-to that encompasses all aspects into a seamless experience. In reality however, apps
            mentioned above exist as silos catered to specific aspects of the overall experience such as discovering recipes,
            meal planning, finding sale offers, and budgeting. As a result, users are inconvenienced by having to use multiple,
            disconnected apps. We are proposing an app that combines all key aspects mentioned above into a single user
            experience.
            <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Survey research</h4>
        <p>
            We generated a survey using Qualtrics to understand people’s attitudes and habits towards recipes and grocery
            shopping. We are thankful to have received 46 responses, which helped us prioritize design areas. Here’s a
            high-level summary, followed by the complete data visualizations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>70% of responses came from age groups 25-34 and 45-54</li>
            <li>Relatively even split between those that cook for 1-2 people vs. 3-5 people</li>
            <li>Majority (61%) shop for groceries once a week</li>
            <li>A slightly greater portion (46%) shop at two stores, over one store (37%)</li>
            <li>Most place importance in saving grocery costs and using store flyers</li>
            <li>Requiring too many ingredients and unavailability of certain ingredients at home are the top two factors
                discouraging people from trying new recipes</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="personas">User personas</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I created two user personas by progressively filtering through survey data. I started filtering down responses by
            those who rated ‘saving grocery costs’ as important or somewhat important. I then split the pool into two cohorts,
            one for those who cook for 1-2 household members and the other for 3-5. I picked the biggest age group from each
            cohort to understand their habits further.
        </p>

        <h1 id="solution">Proposed solution</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Primary goals</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Ease dissonance by helping users pick recipes for their everyday meals </li>
            <li>Save users time by finding economical offers for items on their grocery list</li>
            <li>Help users stay within their budget by tracking grocery expenses</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Initial solution was unrealistic</h4>
        <p>The initial solution was to design an app that suggests recipes tailored to a user’s diet preferences and meal
            budget. Each recipe would have an associated price per serving based on ingredient prices at local
            grocery stores. After the user adds recipes to their recipe plan, they can select offers for ingredients, and
            generate a grocery list based on their selections. After a handful of usability tests using <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/PNdJJ9JliwOLmCTDNvf6xv/Cost-saving-recipe-app?node-id=437%3A2857&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">this prototype</a>, users
            felt:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Price per serving metric for recipes was unintuitive</li>
            <li>Suggested recipes shouldn’t be limited by price per serving</li>
            <li>‘Recipe plan’ flow felt linear and restrictive, especially the snackbar that notifies when the price per serving of
                a recipe exceeds the user’s initial limit</li>
            <li>They were unable to add items not associated with recipes to the grocery list (e.g. chips)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the backend processes would be unnecessarily complex, pulling ingredient prices from local stores to
            calculate the price per serving of recipes a user may not even consider. For said reasons, we abandoned this
            concept.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h4>Revised solution</h4>
        <p>
            Apart from the three primary goals mentioned, we had to design with the aim to get users to start using the app as part of their
            regular grocery trips. Here is a glance at key factors, including how we tackled issues faced by the previous concept.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Open vs. curated recipes</em><br>
            Would the recipes be populated using community contributions or be curated by in-house culinary staff? Each have their
            pros and cons, but we decided on the latter as it allows for standardizing recipes and easier content updates.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Recipe content</em><br>
            The recipes would at the very minimum feature the essentials from cuisines around the world. We categorized them
            into meal types (i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.), as users prefer to find and plan recipes that way. According
            to our survey, YouTube is a major source for recipes as it allows viewers to follow along and relate to chef
            personalities. I incorporated this into the app through my idea of ‘YouTube Weekly’, where users can discover
            trending recipes and make it a part of their meal planning experience. Additionally, all recipes will be available
            to view in a video format.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Doing away with price per serving</em><br>
            After receiving feedback, the price per serving metric was too granular and did not serve users as expected. If our
            goal is to help users save grocery cost, we should rather target their overall expenditures. This not only reduces
            the backend load, but more importantly gives users greater flexibility to cook and shop for what they wish.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Getting rid of 'Recipe plan' flow</em><br>
            Users mentioned the ‘Recipe plan’ flow felt linear and restrictive. They would prefer adding recipe ingredients
            directly to the grocery list without having to go through the step-by-step process that is the ‘Recipe plan’. In the
            revised version, users should be able to populate their grocery list within a few taps.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Adding personal recipes</em><br>
            On most days, people tend to cook meals they are familiar with. For this reason, the app will allow users to record
            their own recipes for future reference and meal planning.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Store preferences</em><br>
            Based on survey responses, 46% shop at two stores per grocery trip, likely for cost saving, product variety, and
            freshness. This infers that people have preferences for the stores they shop at. With this in mind, the app should
            provide users the option to be more selective of the store from which offers are suggested.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Suggested offers for items on grocery lists</em><br>
            Should users be presented with offers to select from or should the app pre-select an offer it thinks is the most
            economical for items on the grocery list? Based on feedback, most wish the app pre-selects the offer for each
            grocery item, while giving its users the flexibility to opt for alternative offers if preferred.
        </p>

        <h1 id="visual-design">Visual design</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>App name and logo</h4>
        <p>
            I came up with Savery, a wordplay between ‘savoury’ and ‘save’. As for the logo, I dabbled with and was drawn to the
            negative space created by the spine of the uppercase S as it loosely resembled the shape of a wooden spatula. I
            generated the variations below and liked the 3rd design, before adding the implied vertical line of the dollar sign on
            the 4th and final version.
        </p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/savery-logo-ideas.png" alt="Savery logo ideas">
        <br>
        <h4>Colour</h4>
        <p>
            For the app’s primary colour, I decided on green as it is typically associated with freshness and finance. I also used
            green to accent various screen elements such as CTA buttons, tab indicators, checkmarks, radio buttons, and certain
            active selections.
        </p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/savery-colour.png" alt="Colour green">
        <br>
        <h4>Typeface</h4>
        <p>
            The mastheads of several food magazines and recipe books use serif typefaces, which factored into my rationale for
            Savery’s typeface choices. I decided on pairing DM Serif Display with Work Sans. DM Serif is a naturally heavier and
            elegant typeface, so it worked well as a H1 header, while Work Sans’ legibility took care of H2 headers and beyond.
        </p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/savery-typeface.png" alt="Typeface">
        <br>
        <h4>Graphical elements</h4>
        <p>
            I obtained certain vector graphics through the free illustration site, Undraw. I downloaded and imported their SVG files
            into Illustrator where I modified them to suit my needs. Recipe photos were sourced from Unsplash and Google Images.
            This is a personal portfolio project and will not be used commercially.

        <h1 id="future-considerations">Future considerations</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Stores without a website/product catalogue</h4>
        <p>
            Many people shop at stores that don’t have a website or a digital product catalogue. Without that data, the current
            version of Savery would be unable to suggest offers from those stores. A potential solution would be to add a store-side
            aspect where grocers sign up and update products on sale, if they find it worthwhile for their business. Savery would
            use this info to ensure their offers are suggested to users. Another idea would be to design an app that builds up a
            community where shoppers can share sale offers they found in-store, which others can filter by the grocery items they
            are looking to buy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Standardizing unit price</h4>
        <p>
            When it comes to groceries, especially produce and meats, there can often be discrepancies when comparing two similar
            products. Lemons for example, can be sold individually (priced as each) and in a bag (priced in lbs.), making it harder
            to decide on the more economical format as they do not share a common unit. To address this, Savery’s backend would
            require a catalogue that dictates how many units of an item are in a unit weight, like knowing there are roughly 4
            lemons in a pound. This backend implementation would be a big undertaking that could be made easier if partnered with a
            grocer that may have all these conversions figured out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Onboarding purchased grocery items from receipt</h4>
        <p>
            Savery can evolve into a more insightful platform with the capability to onboard grocery items a user purchased by
            scanning their receipt. By working with major grocers to implement a QR system or by linking a store card, Savery would
            be able to track and provide users with better insights on their purchasing habits, enabling them to make more informed
            decisions about what they buy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Weekly deals and price watch</h4>

            In the current version, a user can add an item (unassociated with a recipe) to their grocery list using the ‘add item’
            FAB, then find the best offer for it. For future iteration, a ‘weekly deals’ tab could be implemented, allowing users to
            browse through featured offers at local grocery stores and add an item to their grocery list if they wish. They could
            even set notifications for when a certain item goes on sale or drops in price.

        <h4>Diet preferences</h4>
        <p>
            For the project’s sake, I kept the diet selection fairly modest. If Savery were to be developed, users would be able to
            select from a wider range of diet preferences such as high-protein, low-carb, low-fat, keto, paleo, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Social interactions</h4>
        <p>
            While everyone recognized the primary goals of Savery, some mentioned it would be nice to have a social aspect. This
            includes commenting on recipes and joining food interest groups within the app. This aspect could be implemented based
            on user demand, and feasibility on Savery’s end in terms of development and community moderation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Sponsorships and partnerships</h4>
        <p>
            Savery can collaborate with a variety of companies across food and health industries to expand its user base and revenue
            streams. This includes featuring sample recipes curated by top chefs, weight-loss programs, brands like Betty Crocker
            and Pillsbury, and food blogs. Savery can forge tie-ups with grocers to implement a rewards system, and pin sponsored
            offers.

            Firstly, I was amazed with how many people responded to our survey. It was intriguing combing through responses to
            find trends between data points, giving us a better understanding of why people shop the way they do. Working with
            Lillian greatly reduced project time in the initial stages and encouraged me to not overthink design considerations.
            Although work deadlines kept her busy around when we started the mid-fi prototype, she provided feedback as I
            carried through the rest of the project. Lastly, I improved on conducting usability tests by consciously ensuring I
            minimized influencing users on how they interacted with the prototypes. By doing so, it was much easier to notice
            the screen elements users were drawn to.
