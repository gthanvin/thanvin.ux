        <h1>Built a riser to ease discomfort, learn woodworking, and save money</h1>
        <p class="light-grey">October 2021</p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/riser-cover.png" alt="Photo of the riser">
        <p class="light-grey">My very own riser table in action. It features legs that swing down on their own, so I can conveniently prop it up or collapse it within seconds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As our living spaces started to become a recluse for WFH, it became easy to sit through extended periods without
        stretching or moving around. Like many, I felt increasing tightness in my hip flexors and hamstrings over the past year.
        Doing floor stretches and using a foam roller helped but soon after returning to my desk, the tightness crept back.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To make my workspace more comfortable, I looked into buying a riser or standing desk, but most were too big or
            unreasonably priced for their offering. Moreover, Iâ€™ve always wanted to try woodworking, so I seized this situation to
            build a riser that can easily be propped up or collapsed atop my existing desk. This project was made possible through
            the guidance (and tools &#128517) of my friend, Justin, whoâ€™s a pro at woodworking after getting into it a few years back.</p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/riser-table-schematic.jpg" alt="A mockup of the riser on SketchUp">
        <p class="light-grey">I designed a mockup of the riser using SketchUp.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started off by designing the riser using <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.sketchup.com/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free" target="_blank">SketchUp</a>, a free and convenient 3D modelling tool. 
            After Justin's approval, I began browsing for materials on Home Depot. After comparing plywood, medium
            density fibreboard, and particle board, I decided on a Â½ inch plywood as it is relatively strong, lightweight, and has
            some resemblance to real wood. I also bought 1x3x8 framing lumber for the legs, and four hinges to swing them. 
            The total came up to about $40.</p>
        <img class="standard-img" src="../images/riser-materials.jpg" alt="Plywood, framing lumber, and hinges">
        <p class="light-grey">Photos of the Â½ inch plywood, framing lumber, and 2 inch zinc hinges. Framing lumber often have warps
            and other imperfections, so it's a good idea to buy it in-store.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the day, Justin briefed me on power tool safety to avoid <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/how-to/a19188/how-to-prevent-kickback-avoid-injuries-table-saw/" target="_blank">kickback</a> and keep my fingers intact. He also suggested
            adding aprons to the sides of the riser for integrity and visual appeal. I learned to use a table saw to cut the plywood
            and framing lumber, a mitre saw to make angled cuts for the base of the legs, and a table router to carve out Rabbet
            joints on the aprons. At the end, I used a sander to smoothen out edges and applied 3 coats of polyurethane. The whole
            project was completed within a day! ðŸ™Œ</p>

        <p class="light-grey">Performing cross and rip cuts using the table saw, and sanding down the leg blocks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been using my riser on the regular, and itâ€™s greatly improved my focus and eased muscle tension. With it also comes
        the satisfaction knowing itâ€™s something I built from scratch using skills I was unfamiliar with up until then. I can
        appreciate why many prefer to invest their time and money on tools that allow them to fix and build things to improve
        the space around them. I value practical skills and this woodworking project was an inspiring start.
